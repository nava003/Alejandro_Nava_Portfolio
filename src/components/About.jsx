      <h2>Studying, Coding, Learning, Applying</h2>
      <p>
        TLDR: Highschool was when I learned HTML; I grew personal experience by coding personal
        projects; undertook a total of two bootcamps to acquire knowledge; studied video
        game-based coding concepts and business-based technology; acquired an Associates in GS,
        acquired college credits for a Bachelors in Cybersecurity; formally worked as a satellite
        tech aid; continuously learned more tools, html tricks, and methods to keep improving old
        and dated code-work; now looking to apply these skills in a career-based route.

      <h2>Web Development Isn't Hard, Right?</h2>
      <p>
        For many, learning Web Development may sound "easy" or "not a challenging field", but
        that's because they only understand the tip of the iceberg of web development. There's a
        lot more to Web Development than just appearances. How was it structured? Is it easy to
        read when something on the page doesn't work? Does the page even function properly? How
        does it gather data? How does it process said data? Does it even secure the data being
        inserted, sent, and received? How much time was actually spent in building up the page?
        What makes it different than another web page? Thousands of questions to ask, but most
        go unanswered if the developer or dev team can't provide answers with full confidence.
      </p>

      <h2>My Development Story</h2>
      <p>
        I had a passion for web development ever since I was exposed to it in highschool - 
        Lakeview Technology Academy. Back then, I only understood HTML, CSS, and Java, but that
        was enough building blocks to appreciate how webpages were crafted, appeared, and
        interacted with users. I then got involved in 'forum code' (Proboards, JCINK, etc),
        which was more or less a distant cousin of HTML and CSS, but allowed me to explore and
        experiment with HTML and CSS in ways I couldn't in a classroom setting.
        <br/><br/>
        From there, I got involved in learning IT in general, to see what other coding language
        or field would stick to me. Dabbled in hardware knowledge, video game knowledge,
        various software knowledge, attended and passed a coding bootcamp through Gateway
        Technical College, dabbled in satellite knowledge, gained vast amounts of information
        on Cybersecurity through online courses provided by Columbia College of Missouri, and
        now recently attended and passed a newer coding bootcamp through Northwestern University
        + EdX.
        <br/><br/>
        Could I have done most of the coding knowledge on my own through online tutorials
        and videos? Probably, I know a handful who have done that. However, without the
        series of paths I've taken so far, albeit long and frustrating at times, I wouldn't
        have a different perspective that most probably don't realize when they're teaching
        themselves, or simply go find a career based on a one-way education path. That's what
        I'm
